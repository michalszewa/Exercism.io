# Exercism 

Hi! This repository will be about my solutions to problems from Exercism.io platform. It's great place to improve not only development skills for certain language but also become better at thinking.

> ### What is Exercism?
> Exercism is an online platform designed to help you improve your
> coding skills through practice and mentorship.

My solutions are written in **C#** programming language. I've currently solved **almost 50%** of core exercises and a lot of side exercises aswell. But still have a lot to go so I will update this repository constantly with solutions to new problems!
